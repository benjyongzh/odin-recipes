    <h1>Lava Cake</h1>

    <h3>Desserts don't always have to be over the top. They can be simple to make while leaving you with a lingering sweet taste on the tongue.</h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 ounced bittersweet chocolate, preferably Valrhona</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 450Â°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and salt at high speed until thickened and pale.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along with the flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room temperature before baking.</li>
        <li>While these cakes easily stand alone, they're over-the-top when served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
        <li>Chocolate is too intense and bitter for many sweet wines, but not port. Try this dessert with a Ruby Porto.</li>
    </ul>
